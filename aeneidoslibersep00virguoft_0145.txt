NOTES 133

Almo, l. 532, and Galaesus, l. 535. In l. 802 the river itself
is mentioned.

insignem: with ablative ; cf. 11. 612, 655. His arms
were notselicia in this instance, for we hear of his death in
battle 'm xii. 460.

746. horrida, ‘ shaggy‚' especially with reference to their
attii-e.

747. venatu may be ablative, but it is better to take it as
dative, because we have already had that case after adsuetus,
in l. 490. The form is conti-acted from venatui, for which
cf. 1. 724, curru.

Aequicula: take with qens. They were a race of moun-
taimen-rs, dwelling on both banks of the Anio and round
Mount Algidus.

glebis = ablative of description.

748. exercent, ‘till.'

semper . . . rapto: cf. ix. 613.

749. convectare: used iv. 405, otherwise only occurs once
in classical Latin.

vivere = ‘to live on’ takes the same construction as
vesci: the ablative is one of means.

751. ‘ Decked with leaves of the fruitful olive.’

fronde . . . et. felici . . ,oliva form a hendiadys. An
olive crown was the badgc of a priest.

752. missu: ablative of cause.

753. The datii-es depend upon sparyere.

graviter spirantibus contains the ideas (1) that the
very breath of the reptile was poisonous, (2χ that they gave
off a foul smell. The latter is true, the former, like many
of Vergil’s details about snakes, false.

754. cantu = ‘incantatione‘

manu = ‘the touch.'

756. ictum: medicari always takes the dative of the person
healed,l)11t apparently the accusative of the disease, although
the only other case quoted is in Plautus.

757. in vulnera, ‘to heal,' or ‘prevent wounds.' As
a rule in vulnera = ‘to inflict wounds‚' therefore some read
in vulnere here, but there seems no good reason why ιή with
the accusative should be limited to one meaning.

759. Angitiae (others read Anquitiae, supposing the word
to be connected with anquis) was a goddess of enchantments,
sister of the great enchantress, Medea; she had a sacred
grove south of Lake Fucinus in Marsian territory.

vitrea. = ‘ crystal.'

Fucinus: supply lacus.
