INTRODUCTION 13

When, with a laugh, Ascanius—“We devour
The plates and boards on which we fed before.''
Th· auspicious words his sire 111 rapture took,
And weigh'cl what once the oracle had spoke.‘

Passing by versions by Symmons ἡ11111011 indebted to
Dryden—and others, now all but sorgotten, we come 1ο
the translation of Professor Conington, which must rank
as one of the most successful in the English language‚
for, in addition 1ο 110 small poetical merit, it is more
scholarly and accurate than its predecessors. lt is
written in the ballad metre employed with such success
by Scott in Marmion and other poenis, We quote

11. 357-366:

‘Gcntly‚ as mother might, she speaks,
The hot mars rolling down her cheeks‚
Tears for her hapless daughter shed,
And Phrygia's hated bridal bed ε

“And shall a Dardan fugitive,

O father, with Lavinia wife‘?

And will you' not compassion take

For father's, sire’s, or mother's sake?
Aye, well Ι know, the first fair gale,
Shall see the faithless pirate sail,

And bear from home the weeping maid.
The prize of his triumphant raid.

Not thus, forsooth the Phrygian swain
Made stealthy progress o’er the main,
To Sparta won his way, and bore

Fair Helen to the Idaeam shore.

Where now your sacred promise? where
The love you wont your own to bear?
Or where that hand, whose friendly grasp
The hand of Turnus oft would clasp‘?”’

Other nineteenth—century versions are those of Rhoades
and L01·<1B0wen‚the latter of which enjoys a considerable
reputation. The last famous translation is that of
william Morrss, in 1876, written in fourteen-syllable
rhymed couplets one line¹ of English answering to one
