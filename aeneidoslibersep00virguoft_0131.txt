omnisque in nmine portus. This is very difficult,
and may be explained in three different ways. Ἴ) Supply
sum and take portus as genitive, ’Ἰ am altogether on the
threshold of my harbour.’ objections to this are the rare
omission of sum„ and the absence of any defining word with
portus Ξ haven of rest. (2) Supply est, and take portus as·
nominative, ‘all my harbour is at hand.’ Here objections·
are the use of onmis, and the meaning ‘at hand' for in
limine, which cannot be found elsewhere. (3) Omit any
stop at portus and make spolior principal verb, ‘ 1 have won
rest, and now on the threshold of the haven, am robbed
of a happy death.' Perhaps this is the most satisfactory,
although it requires us to insert an emphatic ‘only' with
‘happy death! Compare Ancliises' remark ii. 646 ‘facilis
iactura sepulcris ‘a light matter is the loss of burial,¹
