country habits and manners He was generous and
affable to all, and very modest with regard to his own
same, disliking much the enthusiasm caused by his
appearance in public. He occasionally recited in public,
and had an excellent delivery.

11. Works.

Vergil’s works fall naturally into four divisions: (1)
youthful poems; (2) the Past01·a1s; (3) the Georgics3
(4) the Aeneid. Of these (4) will be considered in the
next section.

(1) A collection of minor poems, most of which are
of little interest, attributed—in many cases obviously
Wrongly—to Vergil.

One piece, which is probany genuine, describes the
pleasure with which the youth says farewell to rhetorio,
grammar, and the like.

Another is the CuleX,‘The Gnatss an obscure prosaic
poem of over 400 lines, certainly no work of Vergil's.
Two shorter poenis, the Moretum, a description of a
sarmer's daily work, and the Copa, a tavern-keeper's
invitation to guests to enter his house, have more claim
to be considered genuine.

Fourteen other short pieces, known as Catalecta, are of
little interest or value.

(2) The ‘ Pastorals ” are ten poenis in hexameter verse,
called also ‘Bucolics ’ (Herdsmen's songs), and ‘Eclogues'
(selections). They purport to describe the life, the songs,
the love, and the strife of shepherds, but are as unreal as
the ‘ swains’ and ‘nymphs' of Pope and his school. To
a great extent they are boi-rowed from the Greek of
Theocritus, whose Idylls deal, but in a much fresher and

more natural manner, with similar topics.
