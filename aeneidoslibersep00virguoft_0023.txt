text, and need not be diseussed here in detail. Ι merely
add two or three famous instances of the latter. Compare

‘quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum‚'

i. e. the grouping together of words beginning with the

‘captivi pendent eurruS, curvaeque secures

spiculaque clipeique ereptaque rostra carinis’ ΚΠ. 184-6j3

and
‘aurea percussum virga versumque venenis' (1. 190.

The last example, alliteration of ‘v,' is especially common.

words, e. g. z

‘tali intus templo divum patriaque Latinus' 'xl- 192 .

The most famous translation, both from its authors
rank as a poet and from the real merit of the work, is
that of John Dryden. It is true that the translator
allowed himself to depart freely—perhaps too freely—
