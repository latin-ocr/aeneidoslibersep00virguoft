82 VERGIL’S AENEID vn

*All at large tables, in long order sot,
Λ rani their offering, and a ram their meat.'—-(Dryden.)

177. Notice the caesura in the fourth root combined, as
often, with elision immediately before it. See Intro—
duction, iv.

ex ordine: cf. l. 139. Here z ‘in a 1·ow.'

178. Observe the hiatus cedro, 1talus ; it is partly due to
the pause after cedro. Vergil uses it especially in Greek
words, above all in proper names. The nse of wooden
statues is intended as a sign of tho simplicity of early days.

1ta1us: a fabulous aneestor, who came from Arcadia,
and taught the Oenotrians agriculture.

Sabinus: son of Sancus, and eponymous hero of the
Sabines, also represented as a god of agriculture.

179. vitisator: borrowed from Attius, who uses it of

Bacchus. ‘The planter of the vine.'

sub imag-ine may = ‘ as a statue? Perhaps it is safer to
take it = having a pruning hook figured on the pedestal
which was the base of the statue. The literal meaning of
sub seems more natural.

180. For Saturnus see Vocabulary of Proper Names.
According to legend he came to Italy after being dethroned
by Juppiter, and his reign was a Golden Age. Janus was the
oldest Italian national god. His name is the same as Dianus,
masculine of Diana, a sun-god, god of the morning, god of
all beginning, and god of gates. He was two-faced to look
in and out of the gate.

181. The vestibulum [ce = out ; stabulum (sto) = a standing
place] was a courtyard in front of a house or temple, pro-
duced by running out the side walls. It was not roofod in,
and was only found in large buildings.

ab origine τ ‘from the beginning': i. e. kings of the
earliest days.

182. †F0r que there is a reading qui, which would make
kings and warriors th(- same. But those mentioned by name
were essentially peaeesul.

183. postibus ἶ ‘on tho ‘loon' So (iii. 286-7) Aeneas
sastens the spoils of Abas on the temple door at Actium.

184. captivus is very rarely used os things. It also occurs
in Vergil with sanquis and vestis.

currus: the ancient war—ehariot was light enough to be
carried, at all events by an ancient hero. Notiee the alliter-
ation of c in these three lines.
