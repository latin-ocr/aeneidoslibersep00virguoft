104 VERGIL’S AENEID vu

424. abnegat, ‘refuses to give thee! So the simple neque,
iii. 171 ‘Dictaea negat tibi Iuppiter arva!

in regnum=‘t0 share the realm.’

quaeritur: not as in the last line buta ‘is sought.’ The
repetition of this word, as of ‘armari . . . in arma‚’ 429-30
may be taken as proof that this book was not finally revised.

425. :nunc ε ironical‚ as often, with the imperative.

ingratis, ‘thankless,' ‘ quorum nulla est grati-‘a’

:in-ise, ‘scorned sool? vocative, by attraction, sor
nominative. Cf. ii. 282-3 “quibus Hector ab oris l exspectate
venis ⁵? ’

426. tege pace Latinos: protect the Latius by eonquering
their ene-inies, and imposing a peace on them.

427. adeo: this word is used with an intensive force with
pronouns <rai-ely ille), moze, iam, ricc, sic, numerals, and the
imperative : e. g. l. 629 ‘quinque adeo’: ‘ full five) Here it
is best translated by emphasizing the haec, ‘This it was
Saturnia bade me . . .'

iaceres=lie asleep‚ as iii. 150 ‘ ante oculos adstare
iacentis in somnis.y The mood is subjunctive because the
sentence is Oratio Obliqua. The direct speech was ‘Say to
him when he sleeps '-—czc1n iacebit.

428. ipsa: probably to be taken with iussis.

Saturnia = J uno.

429. armari: accusativo and infinitive aster para, a con-
struction common with an active, very rare with a passive
infinitive. Hence some prefer to read iube for par«. armari
and ‘moveri are middle. See Appendix.

430. laetus with in arma2·r<=joieiiig to take up arms.⁹
Others take laetias with para, and in arma with moveri. For
repetition see l. 424, note.

431. pictas. In v. 663 we read of stems of painted pine.

exure, ‘slay the chiestains, burn the painted ships.y
For the zeugma (exure being only applicable to carinus) see
1. 271.

432. magna is feminine singular with τίς, ‘the great
might of the heavcnly ones.5

433. aare: opposed to abneffltt, l. 424.

dicto parere: in its usual sense of ‘obey (Juno’s) bid-
ding! Others take it ‘abide by his word! Notice tho
tonsos here ι salutm· is present where futuro would bo
more natural, while future infinitives might be expected
after it.

434. sentiat used absoliitely-sv‘let him feel’ (his follyji.
sussivo subjunctivo. It is also possible to omit the comma
