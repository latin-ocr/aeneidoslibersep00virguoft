12 VERGIL’S AENEID v11

from the original, and that the version at times smacks
as much of Dryden as of Vergil; but the spirit of the
translation falls little below that of the Latin, and if
Vergil was a master of the hexameter, Dryden was
equally without a rival in his command of the ten-
syllabled rhymed couplet.

We quote 11. 601-615:

‘A solemn custom was observed of old,

Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold;
Their standard when in fighting-fields they rear
Against the fierce Hyreanians, οι· declar-0

The Scythian² 1ndian, or Arabian war3

Or from the boasting Parthians would regain
Their eagles, lost in Carrae's bloody plain.

Two gates of steel <the name of Mars they bear,
And still are worshipped with religious sear(¹
Before his temple stand: the dire abodv,

And the fearod issues of the furious god,

Are fenced with brazen bolts; without the gates,
The wary guardian ‹Janus doubly waits.

Then, when the sacred senate notes tho wal-s,
The Roman consul their dee-ree declares,

And in his robes the sounding gates uubars·
The youth in military shouts arise,

And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies!

Another translation iu the sanie metre was the work of
Christopher Pitt, published in the middle of the seven-
teenth century. More literal than Dryden's work, it
falls far short of it iu vig-our and spirit, as the following
passage will be sufficient to show, ll. 107—1 19 : ψ ἡ

‘The heroe with his son and ehiefs had laid
Their limbs at ease beneath a oooling sliade;
Then, dietated by Jove, the bauquet spread
On cakes of flour, along the verdant mead;
The slender cukos the busy Trojans load

With fruits austere, and wildings of the wood.
These scanty viands soon ‹·0nsu1n'd,tho crew
Compell'd by hunger, on their tables ssvw;
Full eager they devour’d, by want distrest,
The smil supper-teis of the sailing feast.
