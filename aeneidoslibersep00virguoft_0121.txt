nores 109

justisy Tyrrhus here, although it lias good manuscript sup-
ort.
p 485. nutribant Ξ nutriebant: this archaic imperfect occurs
occasionally elsewhere in Vergil. Cf. 790 ; iv. 528 ; vi. 468 ;
x. 538.
cui regia parent armenta: simply ε ‘the royal herds-
man.'

487. adsuetum imperiis, ‘accustomed to her bidding.'

soror: i. e. of the Tyrrhidae, not of ΤῃννΙιθῖιε, although
he was the last mentioned.

omni . . . cura. is explained by intexens cornua sertis in the
next line.

489. ferum, ‘ the wild ereatu1-e‚’ not a very happy expres-
sion here, as Vergil is laying stress on the stag's tameness.
For this use of the adjective as noun cf. ii. 51, where it is
applied to the Trojan horse.

490. manum: it is safer to take this as accusative singular
governed by patiens used participially‚ but it is also possible
to look upon it as a contracted genitive plural = manuum,
on the analogy of currum = cummuni, vi. 653. In that case
paticus will be an adjective. Either way the expression
= mansuetus, Gk. χειροήθης. Notice the repetition of adsuetus
aster l. 487, and see note on ll. 423-4.

492. ipse z ‘ofliis own accord‚' i. e. without necding driving.

domum: the usual accusative of motion.

quamvis: in its original meaning ‘ however.’ Even
when it = ‘although' it is generally possible to get the
former meaning out of the sentence.

493. rabidae: notice the gender of cemes. Hunting dogs
are nearly always feminine.

494. commovere, ‘ started.v

fluvio . . . secundo = ‘with (down) the stream’3 ‘up
stream ’ = flutio adverso.

495. Commovere must be taken with the whole of this line,
not only with deflueret, which would make the rest of the
line absurd. The stag was floating down stream or resting
on the bank alternately, and Vergil has not told us which
he was doing when the hounds started him.

ripa: probably local ablative.

497. Ascanius: other name of Iulus.

cornu, ⁴ bow.‘

498. erranti ε ita ut erraret, proleptic use of the adjective,
that is to say, it anticipates the effect produced by the
action of the verb. Cf. iii. 141 ‘steriles exurere agros ’ = ‘ burn
the fields to barrenness!
