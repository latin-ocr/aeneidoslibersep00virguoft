14 VERGIL’S AENEID v11

line of Latin. This remarkable version, of whose en-
during popu1arity 1t is yet too early to speak, is above
all things the work of a ‘true poet, and combines
scholarship with poetic spirit. If it has a fault, it is
that the long, somewhab heavy line⁷ and the translator's
love for employing archaia and Scandinavian diction,
hardly represent happily tho even, stately flow of the
Vergilian hexameter. Severa} quotations will be found
in the notes.
