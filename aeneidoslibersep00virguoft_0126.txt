114 VERGIL’S Ammo vn

embrico must not be lost sight of. We find the latter in
primae commisit funera pugnae, ‘matehed them in
tho first doadly fight.’ committere is the technieal term for
matching a pair of gladiatore, but Vergil was also thinking
of committere puynam, ‘to jain battle.'
funera pugnae is a Vergilian refinement on funestam
puynam.

543. †conversa‚. If the reading is sound coni-ersa must
mean ‘turning hor ssight through the air of heaven,¹ a
shortened form of ‘ conversa et evecta per auras.' Another
reading is convexa, which would have to be taken as in
opposition to auras, a very far-setched construction. Probably
a line has dropped out.

544. victrix: in the broad sens(¹ ‘t1-iun1phantly.' For
a similar use compare ii. 329 ‘victorque Sinon incendia
iniseet,' and iii. 439 ‘sio denique victor Trinacria fines Italos
mittere relicta.'

545. perfecta: ·’ brought to fulfihnent.'

tibi: dative of advantage, ‘thou hast.'

546. ‘ Bid them come together in friendship, and join in
t1·eaty.' Ironical remark, The subjunctives are jussive
depending on dic.

548. hoc is what follows, his what precedes.

certa: supply est: ‘if thy favour is assured ine,⁸ a prosy
and unneeessary remark.

550. accendam: we have had the same use 1. 482.

insani: cf. <insania belli, l. 461. ⁶

551. auxilio: dative of purpose or predicative dative.
usually joined with a dative of the person interested. This
use is confined to the singular. Cf. cordi, 1. 326.

552. contra, ‘in reply.'

terrorum: partitive genitive after abunde, a rare and
late use. Quintilian has abunde. salis: ⁴ plenty of wit.'

553. stant, ‘stand fast.' stare is used in tho poets as
almost equivalent to essa with the added notion of fixity.
So wo find sententia stat, ‘my purpose is fixed,' and stac
impersonally with the sanie soree. sedere is used in a similar
way. Cf. l. 368.

pugnatur: impersonally. ‘ the sight ragesy

554. ‘The arms that chance first gave, fresh blood has
dyed.’ prima τ adverb.

imbuit: seo 1. 542⁷ noto.

555. Notice tho rare rhythin of ihc second soot, and the
four-syllable ending, for which cf. 1. 344, διο.
