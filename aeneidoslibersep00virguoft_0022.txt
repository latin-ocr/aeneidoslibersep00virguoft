10 VERGIL’S AENEID VII

A spondaic ending, i.e. sponclees in both the two last
feet, is rare in Vergil, although common in Greek and
in Catullus. In this case the fourth foot is generally
a dactyl, e. g.

‘Ardea Crmtumerique et turrigerae Antemnae' (l. 63ῐ);
but l. 634 ends with four spondees, for special reasons—
‘aut leves ocreas lento ducunt argento!

The verse usually ends with a word of two or three
syllables, but Vergil allows occasionally words of one
syllable, osten for purposes of emphasis3 and of four or
more syllableS‚ especially in Greek words, e. g.

‘consilium, et saevae nutu Iunonis eunt res' (1. 592).
‘auro insignibat, iam saetis obsita, iarn bos' (l. 790).
and,

‘quam super adventu Teucrum Turnique hymenaeis'
(l- 344)-
Occasionally an elision occurs of a vowel ab the end of
a verse before a vowel at the beginning of the next, e. g.

‘iamque iter elnensi turres ac tecta Latinorum
ardua . . .’ (ll. 160—1).

As a rule no such elision takes place 3 e. g.

‘iamque rubescebat radiis mare, et aethere ab alt«)

Aurora . . .' (11. 25-6).
Other exception-al instances, such as hiatus, and the
lengthening of a short vowel in arsis, will be noticed in
the notes as they occur.

The chief features of Vergil's verse are, (ι l the variety
of his lines; (2) his adaptation of sound to sense.

Both these will be understood after reading a page of
