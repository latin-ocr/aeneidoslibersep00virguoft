INTRODUCTION 9

even vulgar idea-is convincing testimony of an influence
such as has belonged to few poets. So in Mai-lowe's
⁴ Doctor Faustus,' scene vii, we find Fausta saying :—
·The11 up to Naples. . . .
There saw we learned Maro's golden tomi),

The way he cut, an English mile in length,
Thorough a roek of stone in one’s night’s space?

IV. 'Phe Metre of the Aeneid.

The mette of the Aeneid is called hexameter, that is,
the line is divided into six feet, of which the first four
may be indifferently dactyle (— υ υ), or spondees (— -)‚
the fifth is a daetyl, very rarely a spondee, and the last
a spondee, or trochee (- υ). This metre is Greek, hut
was adopted hythe early Roman poets‚ Ennius, Lueretius,
and Cat11llus‚ancl their rough attempts culminated in the
splendid majesty of the Vergili-‘in hexameter—a majesty
never approached by succeeding poets. The most im<
portant feature of the hexameter is the caesura, a cutting
or break in the verse. Usually this occurs in the third
foot⁷ and is either strong, i. e. after the first long syllable
of the foot, the oommonest form, e. g.

‘proxima Circaeae Ι raduntur litora terrae' gl. ιο),
or weak, i. e. aster the trochee in the third foot, e. g.

‘ sed variis· portenta Ι deum terroribus obstant’ xl. 58).
Α less common caesura is in the fourth foot, e. g.

‘ auspiciis; huic progeniem 1 virtute futuram ' (l. 257).

This caesura is frequently found with elision at the end
of the third foot, e.g.

‘quin etiam veterum effigies l ex ordine avorum ' Κ1. 177).
