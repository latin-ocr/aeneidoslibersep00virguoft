83. Albunea. There has been much discussion as to what
and where Albunea was. The Sibyl at Tibur bore this
name, and it is natural to suppose that Vergil refers to
a sulphureus spring in a grove near Tibur. This spring
(Albula) forins a casmde, which suits sonat in l. 84. Itis
objected that Tibur was thirty miles distant, so that some
take Albunea to be tho sulphurous spring Alticri on the
road to Ardea. Probably the. former view is the better. At
all events Albunea must bc a grove as well as a stream,
otherwise nemorum qnae murima> is unintelligible. Translate,
‘He conssults 'the graves ab tho soot, of lofty Albunea, which,
mightiest of woods, resounds with its holy fountain and in
